								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>My name is Nathan Deinlein. Currently, I am working as the Manager of Data Engineering for Frontier Airlines. I have spent the last two and a half years at Frontier, working to hone my skills in both data engineering, visualization, and data integration. Prior to this, I was working on a Data and Process analyst for a Tangoe, handling onboarding and solution architecting of data for new customers and existing customers utilizing the logistics services Tangoe provided.</p>
								<p>In 2022, I completed my masters degree in Data Science from Southern Methodist University. I am constantly looking to continue my growth as a professional in the Data Science space. This website is a chance for me to display some of my <a href="#work"> work</a> as continue that journey. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Work</h2>
								<p>My data journey began at Tangoe. My main function there was solutioning customers with our SaaS CRM portal. This involved taking customer user stories, fitting our software to meet those needs, and managing each projects myriad of details. This often involved balancing teaching customers best practices and suggesting more efficient alternatives to their current processes while keeping things familiar enough that they could easily make the transition. I was also responsible for internal process creation and improvement for our global logistics team. This had me working with both Oracleâ€™s NetSuite warehouse management databases and our CRM portals, building efficiencies and integrations. I also sought additional training through Tangoe's internal Sigma Six program to receive my Yellow Belt certification.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>While still at Tangoe, I decided to push forward with my data science journey by working on my masters degree from SMU. In August of 2022, I completed this milestone, presenting my first paper to be published alongside my group partners. We ended up taking home the prize for the best capstone presentation of the graduating class. Since then our paper on use of NLP in the classroom for teacher to assist in grading and giving feed back to students on their writing skills, has been downloaded over one hundred times.</p>

								<p></p>
								<p>While still in school, I changed jobs to allow me to work more in the field that I was attempting to enter. I joined Frontier Airlines in their revenue management team as a data analyst. At Frontier, I have worked in a number of capacities allowing me to dabble in many areas of data science. My first tasks on arriving were to extract information from CRM portals and transform that data using excel to create visualizations. As this was extremely manual, I proceeded to map our main databases, and create a logic dictionary to build reporting on. I then automated the processes, first through use of python scripts and a VM, but then through pyspark and Databricks when that tool became available to us. I then set about building medallion architecture tables for most of the revenue management reporting needs within my department. Building on this framework, we started to create customer centric reporting and personalized marking campaigns using machine learning applications and pipelines. Once these were deployed we looked at monitoring the results to ensure statistical significance between the control and test groups of our marketing campaigns. From there I was asked to create a child seating algorithm to automatically place children 13 and younger with an adult from their booking for free. This was in order to meet a request from the DOT, and I completed the work in three weeks. Building the first automated algorithm in the country. Similar algorithms have been released since by Alaska and JetBlue. But major airlines like Delta, United Airlines, and American Airlines have not built anything similar to my knowledge.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p>In September of this year, I took over as Manager of Data Engineering. Currently, I manage a team of 26 data engineers to create pipelines for everything from basic data replication, to streaming of social media data responses. I am leading projects like retirement of old systems (Microsoft Synapse & SQL), our movement to cloud platforms (Databricks and Snowflake), and creation of our Customer 360 platform that utilizes customer aggregated data through Databricks, as well as connecting with loyalty information, DOT complains, and real time event tracking for customer displacement through Microsoft Dynamics 365.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Case Study 1</h2>
								<p><a href="https://nedeinlein.github.io/#work">Back</a></p>
								<p></p>
								<p> For this assignment, we were assigned into groups of three and were given two data sets and asked to provide business insights into the data as if we were working for Budweiser. The data sets not only needed to be cleaned before use, but also needed to be joined into a single set to be properly used for this study. We were allowed to add in any additional data sources we wished to compliment our data and present better findings to the fictional Budweiser CEO and CFO. Below you can see an overview of the findings in addition to links for the GitHub Repository created for the project and an app I created to display the data. </p>

								<p> This was the final assignment for our DDS 6306 class. This individual project required me to take a data set and apply EDA and machine learning models to answer a fictional clients questions about retaining talent in their business. During the EDA process I found it easier to use an application I built to cycle back and forth quickly inbetween variables in the data set. Below you can see an overview of the findings in addition to links for the GitHub Repository created for the project and the EDA app I created. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Twitter API Ingestion</h2>
								<p><a href="https://nedeinlein.github.io/#work">Back</a></p>
								<p> This was the final assignment for our database management class. I worked with a group of two other students to conduct research into the ingestion of data from an API as well as its final state in a SQL versus noSQL database. My section was to go through parsing out the data retrieved through the API into set columns within an SQL database. Though we could define tags within the data coming across, it's unstructured nature was not entirely conducive to an SQL environment. Instead, due to rate of ingestion, and then usability of the data after ingestion, we suggested the use of a noSQL database, in this case MongoDB, for our purposes, should be tasked with a similar project in the future. Since completing this project, I have been working much more in Azure Datalakes and Databricks in particular with ingestion of files at a rapid pase that can then be parsed later to flatten them if needed. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Machine Learning 1</h2>
								<p><a href="https://nedeinlein.github.io/#work">Back</a></p>
								<p> Machine Learning was a fascination I had going into my masters. For our first class on it, we were split into groups and were given a dataset to try various algorithms on to test our understanding. Our data happened to be on horse racing. We set out with two main goals, the first to be able to predict a winner of any given race, and then the second goal was to predict the top 3, or placers, for any given race. I have below here our final notebook for the project that utilized a number of concepts that we were learning at the time. These included PCA and clustering alogrithms. These unsupervised learning techniques were used to reduce the number of features we were working with to try to make the model more generalized instead of overfitting it to the data we had. You will also note that in a number of the times we run our random forest, it is running a series of different parameters. I wasn't aware of grid search and random search at the time, and this was my attempt to do something similar with the knowledge that I had at the time.</p>

								<h2 class="major">NLP Work</h2>
								<p><a href="https://nedeinlein.github.io/#work">Back</a></p>
								<p> One of the last classes that I took before graduation was on NLP. In this class we took permalinks from IMDB and then would use them as cases to parse text using a number of different python packages. Once we had these different blobs of text information, we could work on parsing them, tokenization, removing stopwords, vectorization, and finally sentiment analysis. My github provides and overall look at this progression from simple document similarity all the way through our final assignment that involved comment sentiment analysis that can be seen in the final homework assignment.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Child Seating Algorithm</h2>
								<p><a href="https://nedeinlein.github.io/#work">Back</a></p>
								<p> In around August of 2022, the DOT formally announced that it would be requesting that airlines within the United States make a conscious effort to make sure that children were always sitting with an adult from their booking next to them on flights. While this sounds like common sense to most of us, traditionally this had not been the case for airlines. The majority of the airline industry uses one of only a few web-based products to handle all of their reservations and bookings and none of these innately had logic to seat passengers like this. Instead, most used some sort of randomized pattern based on how many people had checked in for their flight and the expected weight necessary to balance the plane for takeoff. Conversely, a family could choose seats, but for some carriers, this involved an extra cost. To meet with the DOT recommendation, I was asked to build an algorithm that would take children who had not had a seat purchased for them, and play Tetris with the bookings and open seats of the plane to both ensure that passengers under the age of 13 were sat with an adult from their booking, and that the plane was loaded in a way that risk of a tail tip was minimized. The code in my github is a generalized version of this algorithm that I am making available. I had asked if we as a company wanted to patent it, since only American and United had made the commitment to the DOT to seat children accordingly and both used a manual process to achieve this, however, no one seemed to be terribly concerned with the whole idea. So here I am making this open source in the hope that more airlines will use this to better the experience of their customers.   </p>

								<h2 class="major">Videos</h2>
								<p>During my time at SMU, we were asked to create a number of videos where we explained the work that we had done and got practice in presenting more complex topics in a simplified way. My favorite video, by far that I completed for this, was my second machine learning class. We were asked to pick a topic that interested us and do a deep dive. For mine, I selected the Q-learning algorithm, which is the basis for some types of reinforced learning ML models.</p>
								<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bBHT0yTMq1k?si=wTdc8jhkrgnZPT5u">Q Learning Video</a></p>
								<p></p>
								<p>While at Frontier, I taught a number of classes on SQL and Python to groups of analysts we had on staff. However, in October of 2023, one of my friends asked me if I would sit down and film some basic videos on how to do the basics of being a data analyst, scientist, and engineer. My goal in this series of videos that I then posted to youtube, was to walk him and a number of my co-workers who found out about this project, through the basics of how do we think about data, and getting started with their first coding language, through their first ETL pipeline. These videos are all still a work in progress, but I am working on adding a few more that go through things like loggers, and simple data checks that can be built with relatively low effort to automate a number of the tasks they might have as a starting data analyst.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Apps</h2>
								<p>These are two of the apps, I put together in the first months of my graduate work.</p>
								<p><a href="https://nedeinlein.shinyapps.io/Beer_App/">Beer Data App</a></p>
								<p>This first app was created to quickly show the EDA data from the first case study that I was given in my Doing Data Science course at SMU.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p><a href="https://nedeinlein.shinyapps.io/EDA_App/">Case Study 2 EDA App</a></p>
								<p>This second app was designed to make doing exploratory data analysis for my second case study project easier. Rather than having to go back and find code to run to look at a graphic again, using the app, I could quickly pull up whichever variables I needed for a quick look at the raw data again.</p>
